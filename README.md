This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

# Indie Music Directory

## Project Overview
This project is an Indie Music Directory, a content-driven website that helps users discover independent music tracks and artists based on genre, mood, and year.

2. **Song Listing Page**: Display all tracks with search and filter options.
3. **Song Detail Page**: Programmatically generated for each song with detailed information.
4. **Derived Pages**: Genre, mood, and year pages generated from the dataset.

## Global UI
- Clean navigation and footer with project description and links.
- Fully responsive design with dark mode support.

## SEO & Performance
- Static generation and SEO-ready metadata.

## AI Usage
- AI tools will be used for dataset generation, page scaffolding, and design inspiration.

## Deliverables
- GitHub repository
- Live Vercel deployment URL
- README with project details and AI prompt examples.

## Improvements
- List potential improvements for future iterations.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
